# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the task execution system by adding comprehensive timing information and a metrics collection system. The enhancement includes tracking start/end times for boundary calls and main function execution, implementing a new metrics boundary similar to the existing metadata boundary, and refactoring execution records across the task and hive-sdk packages for better maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the task execution system, I want to track timing information for boundary calls and main function execution, so that I can analyze performance and identify bottlenecks in my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a boundary call starts THEN the system SHALL record the start timestamp
2. WHEN a boundary call ends THEN the system SHALL record the end timestamp
3. WHEN the main function execution starts THEN the system SHALL record the start timestamp
4. WHEN the main function execution ends THEN the system SHALL record the end timestamp
5. IF timing information is available THEN the execution record SHALL include all timing data
6. WHEN accessing execution records THEN timing information SHALL be available for analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to collect custom metrics during task execution, so that I can track business-specific measurements and performance indicators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call a setMetrics boundary THEN the system SHALL store the provided metrics
2. IF metrics are provided THEN they SHALL follow the format {type: string, name: string, value: number}
3. WHEN multiple metrics are set THEN they SHALL be stored as an array in the execution record
4. IF no metrics are set THEN the metrics array SHALL be empty
5. WHEN accessing execution records THEN all collected metrics SHALL be available
6. IF invalid metric format is provided THEN the system SHALL reject the metric with appropriate error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the codebase, I want execution records to be consistent and maintainable across task and hive-sdk packages, so that I can easily add new features and fix bugs without duplicating code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN execution records are defined THEN they SHALL use a shared interface or base type
2. IF changes are made to execution record structure THEN they SHALL be automatically reflected in both packages
3. WHEN new fields are added to execution records THEN they SHALL be available in both task and hive-sdk
4. IF execution record validation is needed THEN it SHALL be centralized and reusable
5. WHEN serializing execution records THEN the format SHALL be consistent across packages
6. IF execution record types change THEN breaking changes SHALL be minimized through proper abstraction

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing task performance, I want detailed timing breakdowns in execution records, so that I can understand where time is spent during task execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing execution records THEN I SHALL see start and end times for the main function
2. WHEN viewing execution records THEN I SHALL see start and end times for each boundary call
3. IF multiple boundary calls occur THEN each SHALL have its own timing information
4. WHEN calculating durations THEN the system SHALL provide helper methods or computed properties
5. IF timing data is missing THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully without errors
6. WHEN exporting execution records THEN timing information SHALL be included in standard formats

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using metrics, I want the metrics boundary to behave consistently with existing boundaries like setMetadata, so that I can use familiar patterns and APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using setMetrics boundary THEN it SHALL follow the same pattern as setMetadata
2. IF setMetrics is called multiple times THEN metrics SHALL be accumulated in the array
3. WHEN replaying tasks THEN metrics boundaries SHALL be handled consistently with other boundaries
4. IF boundary mocking is used THEN setMetrics SHALL be mockable like other boundaries
5. WHEN testing tasks THEN metrics boundaries SHALL be testable with existing patterns
6. IF validation fails for metrics THEN error handling SHALL be consistent with other boundaries
